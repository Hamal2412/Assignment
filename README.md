#### Overview
This script automates the navigation and interaction with web elements on the FitPeo website using Selenium WebDriver in Java. The objective is to navigate to the Revenue Calculator page, interact with the slider and text field, select specific CPT codes, and validate the total recurring reimbursement.

#### Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. **Eclipse IDE**: (or any preferred IDE for Java development). You can download it from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
3. **Selenium WebDriver**: Add Selenium WebDriver to your project dependencies. You can download it from [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).
4. **WebDriver for your browser**: e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome. You can download ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

### Project Setup
1. **Create a new Java project** in your IDE.
2. **Add Selenium library** to your project dependencies:
   - Download Selenium WebDriver JAR files and add them to your project's build path.
   - Download ChromeDriver and set the path to `chromedriver.exe` in your system's PATH or specify the path in your code.


### Detailed Explanation

1. **Import necessary modules**:
   - `By`, `JavascriptExecutor`, `WebDriver`, `WebElement`, `ChromeDriver`, `WebDriverWait`, and `ExpectedConditions` for various Selenium functionalities.

2. **Main function**:
   - Set the path to your `chromedriver` executable using `System.setProperty`.
   - Initialize the Chrome WebDriver.

3. **Navigate to FitPeo Homepage**:
   - Use `driver.get("http://www.fitpeo.com")` to navigate to the homepage.

4. **Navigate to the Revenue Calculator Page**:
   - Wait until the "Revenue Calculator" link is clickable using `WebDriverWait` and click it.

5. **Scroll down to the Slider section**:
   - Wait until the slider element is present and scroll into view using `JavascriptExecutor`.

6. **Adjust the Slider to set its value to 820**:
   - Use `JavascriptExecutor` to set the slider's value to 820.

7. **Validate the slider value**:
   - Check if the slider's value is updated to 820 by comparing the attribute value of the text field.

8. **Update the Text Field to 560**:
   - Clear the text field, enter the value 560.

9. **Validate that the slider is updated to 560**:
   - Check if the slider's value is updated to 560 by comparing the attribute value of the slider.

10. **Scroll down further and select the checkboxes for CPT codes**:
    - Select the checkboxes for specific CPT codes by iterating through their IDs.

11. **Validate Total Recurring Reimbursement**:
    - Check if the total recurring reimbursement header shows the correct value by verifying the text.

12. **Exception Handling**:
    - Catch any exceptions that occur and print the stack trace for debugging.

13. **Finally**:
    - Close the browser using `driver.quit()`.

### Conclusion

This script demonstrates how to automate web interactions using Selenium in Java. Make sure to replace placeholder IDs with the actual IDs from the FitPeo website. Handle exceptions appropriately to ensure robustness against changes in the website's structure. Test the script thoroughly before submission.
